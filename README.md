# Meme-Generator
Udacity sourced project as part of a nano-degree in Intermediate Python

As part of the Udacity nano-degree in Python, I have created a web-based application that both creates random canine-based motivational memes, and allows the user to develop their own.

To get the app up and running, please install its requirements from the eponymous file by running

pip install -r requirements.txt

As part of the project, the command line utility using the app 'Xpdfreader' has been worked into the code as a subprocess method. To allow this to run, please download this app from https://www.xpdfreader.com/download.html and, if you are using Windows, set your system PATH variable to search for it using the environment commands in your Control Panel.

The entry point for the code is to run the command:

python app.py

Thanks for taking the time to read this, any feedback greatly appreciated.

Toby
